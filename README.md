# GNOME Battery Clock

A GNOME shell extension modified for my own needs, to show the time your battery will be flat/charged rather than displaying the amount of time remaining. Inspired by Pixel Launcher

Charge/discharge completion time:

Charge/discharge completion time (with under an hour remaining):
